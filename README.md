I used the following API to generate different funtionslities.

https://market.mashape.com/neutrinoapi/phone-validate
key: “create your own”

But you need to login and get your key for mashape.com and after getting the key
you need to change the Default.aspx.cs at this line
serviceRequest.Headers.Add("X-Mashape-Key", "key"); 

Run the code
  
  Try to run the code(defualt.aspx) using .NET framework and explore the results by giving inputs for the different web APIs.
